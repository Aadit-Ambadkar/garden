@dataclass
class step:
    """The `step` decorator wraps a callable to be used as a single step in a `Pipeline`.

    IMPORTANT: When included in a `Pipeline`, all `step`s will be checked for
    composability with respect to their argument-and return-type annotations.
    This requires that the decorated function has complete argument- and
    return-type annotations; a `step` will fail to initialize with an exception
    if this condition is not met. Note that there is (currently) no
    type-checking at runtime; annotations are taken in good faith.

    See "Notes" below for additional discussion on composing steps with multiple
    arguments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    func: Callable
        `func` is whatever gets called when this `step` is reached in its
        `Pipeline`, and is passed the output of the previous step (if one
        exists) as argument(s).  Typically a plain python function, but a
        callable object with a sufficiently-annotated `__call__` magic method is
        also acceptable. When `step` is used as a decorator, `func` is the
        decorated function. To be composable as a step, the following are
        *required*:
            1. For all but the first step in a pipeline, `func` must only
               require positional arguments, each of which must be annotated
            2. For any but the last step in a pipeline, `func` must return
               either a single object (if subsequent step has a single
               positional arg) or a tuple (if subsequent step has multiple
               positional args)
        This ought to be a `pure function<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function>`_, or as close to one as possible.

    title: str
        An official name or title for the step. Currently, `func.__name__` is used as a default.

    authors: List[str]
        The main researchers involved in producing the step, for citation and discoverability
        purposes. Behavior of this is currently TBD:
            - Do we want authorship to propagate to/from steps to pipelines/gardens?
            - Do we want authorship to propagate as a "contributor"? How far should it go?
            - Do steps need contributors?
    uuid: UUID
        short for "uuid"

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `func` has any arguments without annotations, is missing a return
        annotation, or has `None` as a return annotation.

    Notes
    -----
    We require annotations because we need `step`s to be composable functions in
    their respective `Pipeline`s. However, due to python's highly flexible
    `*args` syntax, function composition is inherently ambiguous -- e.g. if we
    wish to compose `f` with `g`, and `g` returns a tuple of values, should that tuple be passed to `f`
    as a tuple (i.e. `f(g(*args))`), or should it be unpacked as individual
    arguments to `f` (i.e. `f(*g(*args))`, noting the extra ``*``)?

    To resolve this ambiguity, we could either (a) restrict the set of acceptable
    callables to be only those with a single argument and a single return value, or
    (b) rely on thorough function annotations to disambiguate. While best practices
    are likely to stick to single-input-single-output `step`s, we currently try
    to support (b) by composing steps together differently if `g` seems to be
    returning an "argument tuple" for `f` as follows:
        - `g` must have annotations indicating the types within the tuple, e.g. `def g(...) -> tuple[str, int, pd.DataFrame]`
        - `f` must have exactly those argument annotations, e.g. `def f(x: str, y: int, z: pd.DataFrame) -> ...`
        - if both are true, compose by unpacking like `f(*g(*args))`, otherwise `f(g(*args))` like any other step.

        The main researchers involved in producing the Garden. At least one
        author is required in order to register a DOI. Personal name format
        should be: "Family, Given".

    title: str

        A brief summary of the Garden and/or its purpose, to aid discovery by
        other Gardeners.

    Optional Attributes
    --------------------
    doi: str
        A garden's doi can be manually set by the user, or generated automatically via the
        DataCite rest api using the required fields.

    language: str
        Recommended values are IETF BCP 47, ISO 639-1 language codes, such as:
        "en", "de", "fr". Defaults to "en".

    tags: List[str]
        Tags, keywords, classification codes, or key phrases pertaining to the Garden.

    year: str
        Defaults to current year. This attribute should be formatted 'YYYY'.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a new Garden with a ``GardenClient`` instance::

        gc = GardenClient()
        pea_garden = gc.create_garden(
            authors=["Mendel, Gregor"], title="Experiments on Plant Hybridization"

    Notes
    --------
    Mendel's work was ignored by the scientific community during his lifetime,

    To remedy this, if the doi field is unset when registering the
    garden, we could just build one for the user with the datacite api.
    This could also eventually be exposed as a `register_doi()` method.
